# Working Agreement for Kenny Personas

- Scope: Local-first operation. Any network egress must follow the allowlist per ADR.
- Approvals: Calendar actions require explicit human approval. Propose but do not create events without approval. Web Chat is the default approvals channel; Telegram/WhatsApp/iMessage are optional future channels.
- Process: plan → design → implement → test.
- Alignment: Follow `docs/architecture/decision-records/` and `docs/architecture/security-posture.md`.
- Implementation: Prefer minimal, precise edits; maintain readability; prepare atomic commits with clear motivation; avoid broad refactors.
