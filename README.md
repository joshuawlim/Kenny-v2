This repository uses a lightweight architecture governance approach so that design decisions are explicit, versioned, and easy to evolve.

### Architecture Docs
- See `docs/architecture/` for:
  - Principles and non-functional requirements (NFRs)
  - Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
  - C4 diagrams
  - Module specifications and templates

### How we make architecture decisions
1. Create an ADR using the template in `docs/architecture/templates/adr-template.md`.
2. Link the ADR in your PR and summarize the change in the PR description.
3. Update diagrams/specs under `docs/architecture/` as needed.

### Contributing to architecture
- Propose changes via ADRs.
- Keep module boundaries and interfaces documented using the module spec template.
- Update diagrams with each significant change.
