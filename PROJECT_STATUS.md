## 🏗️ System Architecture Overview

### Multi-Agent System Components
- **Gateway Service** (Port 9000): Unified user interface with intelligent routing
- **Coordinator Service** (Port 8002): LangGraph-based multi-agent orchestration  
- **Agent Registry** (Port 8001): Central service discovery and health monitoring
- **7 Operational Agents**: Mail, Contacts, Memory, WhatsApp, iMessage, Calendar, Gateway

### Key Architectural Principles
- **Local-First**: All processing occurs locally with no external dependencies
