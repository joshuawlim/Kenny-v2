## V2.1 Vision

Building on V2.0's production-ready foundation, V2.1 addresses critical architectural bottlenecks to achieve **intelligent agent-led services**, **optimized LLM performance**, and **sub-5 second response times** while maintaining local-first principles.

---

## V2.0 Baseline Summary

**Architecture**: 7 operational agents with LangGraph coordinator  
**Performance**: <30ms coordinator, 1.2ms direct routing (but 44s initial Mail response)  
**Interface**: React dashboard (port 3001), API Gateway (port 9000)  
**Launch**: One-click via `./kenny-launch.sh`  

**Current Bottlenecks Identified**:
- **Non-intelligent services**: Mail/Messages/Calendar/Contacts as basic API wrappers
- **Coordinator model issues**: Qwen3:8b safety triggers affecting tool engagement
- **Performance degradation**: 44s initial responses, minimal semantic caching

   - Update roadmap based on performance validation results
   - Clear agent contexts for fresh performance assessment

### Success Criteria for Decision Making
- **Target Met** (8-12s): Phase 3.2 sufficient, move to production hardening
- **Partial Success** (12-20s): Evaluate Phase 3.5 cost/benefit 
- **Target Missed** (>20s): Debug and optimize Phase 3.2 before proceeding

**Note**: This document reflects the current state of V2.1 development with completed Phase 1A/1B, Phase 2, and Phase 3.2 (all three sub-phases) work. All strategic research, critical fixes, and performance optimizations are implemented, requiring immediate performance validation to determine next development phase.
