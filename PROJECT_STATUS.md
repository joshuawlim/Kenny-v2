## V2.1 Vision

Building on V2.0's production-ready foundation, V2.1 addresses critical architectural bottlenecks to achieve **intelligent agent-led services**, **optimized LLM performance**, and **sub-5 second response times** while maintaining local-first principles.

---

## V2.0 Baseline Summary

**Architecture**: 7 operational agents with LangGraph coordinator  
**Performance**: <30ms coordinator, 1.2ms direct routing (but 44s initial Mail response)  
**Interface**: React dashboard (port 3001), API Gateway (port 9000)  
**Launch**: One-click via `./kenny-launch.sh`  

**Current Bottlenecks Identified**:
- **Non-intelligent services**: Mail/Messages/Calendar/Contacts as basic API wrappers
- **Coordinator model issues**: Qwen3:8b safety triggers affecting tool engagement
- **Performance degradation**: 44s initial responses, minimal semantic caching
