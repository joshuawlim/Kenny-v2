- ✅ Agent manifest aligned with registry schema requirements
- ✅ **LIVE APPLE MAIL INTEGRATION** with performance optimizations
- ✅ All success measures achieved

**Success Measures**:

- [x] Agent manifest declares correct capabilities and data scopes
- [x] macOS Bridge integration functions correctly
- [x] API service can communicate with mail agent
- [x] **Performance optimized: first request ~44s, cached requests ~0.008s**

**Acceptance Criteria (Live Data + Performance)**:
- [x] With `MAIL_BRIDGE_MODE=live` and bridge healthy, `POST /capabilities/messages.search` returns ≥1 item from the bridge (non-mock).
- [x] Agent routes `messages.search` via `mail_bridge` tool; no mock data paths in runtime.
- [x] Bridge URL is configurable via `MAC_BRIDGE_URL` (default `http://localhost:5100`).
- [x] Bridge `GET /v1/mail/messages` returns a list of `MailMessage` objects with caching.
- [x] **Performance: first request ~44s (JXA), cached requests ~0.008s (2min TTL)**.
- [x] E2E smoke test can start bridge (live), start agent, and verify non-mock results.

**Performance Optimizations Implemented**:
- ✅ **HTTP Connectivity Fixed**: JXA execution made async with thread executor
- ✅ **Response Caching**: 120s TTL for live mail data at bridge level
- ✅ **Timeout Management**: 60s JXA timeout, 65s HTTP read timeout
- ✅ **Fallback System**: HTTP → curl → direct import (all working)

**Test Checklist**:
1. Start bridge: `MAIL_BRIDGE_MODE=live python3 bridge/app.py`.
2. Start agent: `python3 -m uvicorn services/mail-agent/src.main:app --port 8000`.
3. Verify bridge: `curl http://localhost:5100/v1/mail/messages?mailbox=Inbox&limit=3` returns real items.
4. Verify agent: `curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/capabilities/messages.search -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"input": {"mailbox": "Inbox", "limit": 3}}'` returns the same live items.
5. **Performance test**: Second request should be instant (<1s) due to caching.

**Phase 1.1 Alignment Tasks (COMPLETED)**:
- [x] Align SDK manifest generation with registry schema (map `parameters_schema` → `input_schema`, `returns_schema` → `output_schema`; include `data_scopes`, `tool_access`, `egress_domains`, `health_check`).
- [x] Update SDK Registry client to send `AgentRegistration` shape: `{ manifest, health_endpoint }`.
- [x] Normalize registry `/capabilities` response or coordinator client filtering so discovery returns usable entries for a specific agent.
- [x] Configure Caddy or registry allowlist so Mail Agent can reach Bridge via an allowed local domain (`kenny.local`).
