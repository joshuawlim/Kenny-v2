## Agent Registration & Startup Procedures

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install Kenny Agent SDK
cd services/agent-sdk && pip3 install -e .
```

### Service Startup Order
1. **Agent Registry** (Port 8001): Central service discovery
2. **Agent Services** (Ports 8000, 8003, 8004): Individual agents
3. **Bridge** (Port 5100): Live data integration
4. **Coordinator** (Port 8002): Orchestration service

### Agent Registration Process
Each agent automatically registers with the registry on startup using:
- Agent ID: `mail-agent`, `contacts-agent`, `memory-agent`
- Health endpoint: `http://localhost:PORT/health`  
- Capabilities: Defined in agent manifest
- Data scopes: Following pattern `domain:subdomain`

## Development Patterns

### Agent Development (Using Agent SDK)
1. **Extend BaseAgent**: Inherit from `kenny_agent.base_agent.BaseAgent`
2. **Create Capability Handlers**: Extend `BaseCapabilityHandler`
3. **Register Tools**: Use `register_tool()` for external integrations
4. **Health Monitoring**: Implement health checks and monitoring

### Bridge Integration
1. **Add Endpoints**: New routes in `bridge/app.py`
2. **Environment Modes**: Support demo/live via env vars
3. **Caching Strategy**: Implement appropriate TTL for data
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and logging

### Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components
2. **Integration Tests**: Test service interactions
3. **E2E Tests**: Full workflow validation
4. **Performance Tests**: Measure response times and caching

## Notes
- **Local-First**: All operations default to local processing
- **Network Egress**: Strictly controlled via allowlist per ADR-0012
- **Approval Workflows**: Calendar actions require explicit human approval via Web Chat
- **Privacy**: All data processing occurs locally with user control
- **Extensibility**: New agents can be added without coordinator changes
