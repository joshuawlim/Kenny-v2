## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### 1. Security Service Not Available
```bash
# Check if security module is loaded
curl http://localhost:8001/health
# Look for security_monitor initialization in logs
```

#### 2. Network Enforcement Not Working
```bash
# Verify enforcement is enabled
curl http://localhost:8001/security/enforcement/status
# Check enforcement_enabled: true
```

#### 3. Dashboard Not Loading
```bash
# Verify static files are served
curl http://localhost:8001/security/ui
# Check for 200 response and HTML content
```

#### 4. High False Positive Rate
```bash
# Review egress rules
curl http://localhost:8001/security/egress/rules
# Add legitimate destinations to allowlist
```

### Log Analysis
```bash
# Monitor security events
tail -f logs/agent-registry.log | grep "SECURITY"

# Check for violations
grep "VIOLATION" logs/agent-registry.log

# Monitor automated responses
grep "AUTOMATED" logs/agent-registry.log
```

## üîí Security Best Practices

### 1. Regular Security Reviews
- **Weekly**: Review open incidents and response effectiveness
- **Monthly**: Analyze security trends and adjust rules
- **Quarterly**: Validate compliance and update procedures

### 2. Incident Response Procedures
1. **Critical Incident** (Response <30s)
   - Automatic service isolation
   - Immediate administrator notification
   - Data quarantine if needed

2. **High Priority** (Response <5min)
   - Enhanced monitoring activation
   - Access review scheduling
   - Manual investigation required

3. **Medium/Low Priority** (Response <1hr)
   - Audit logging enhancement
   - Trend analysis
   - Preventive rule adjustments

### 3. Access Control
- **Dashboard Access**: Restrict to authorized security personnel
- **API Access**: Implement authentication for management endpoints
- **Bypass Approvals**: Require dual approval for sensitive bypasses
