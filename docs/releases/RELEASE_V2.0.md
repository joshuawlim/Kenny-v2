## System Architecture

### Core Components
| Component | Port | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| React Dashboard | 3001 | Modern web interface with real-time monitoring |
| API Gateway | 9000 | Unified entry point with intelligent routing |
| Coordinator | 8002 | LangGraph-based multi-agent orchestration |
| Agent Registry | 8001 | Service discovery and health monitoring |
| Mail Agent | 8000 | Apple Mail integration with caching |
| Contacts Agent | 8003 | macOS Contacts with enrichment |
| Memory Agent | 8004 | ChromaDB + Ollama embeddings |
