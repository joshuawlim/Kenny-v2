## Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

Document target quality attributes. Replace TBDs with measurable targets once known.

- Performance: TBD (e.g., p95 latency â‰¤ X ms for endpoint Y)
- Throughput: TBD (e.g., sustain Z req/s)
- Availability: TBD (e.g., 99.9% monthly)
- Reliability: TBD (e.g., SLOs/SLIs defined per critical path)
- Security & Compliance: TBD (e.g., OWASP ASVS level, data handling)
- Scalability: TBD (e.g., scale-out strategy, limits)
- Observability: TBD (e.g., dashboards, alerts for top N KPIs)
- Maintainability: TBD (e.g., cyclomatic complexity, docs completeness)
- Portability: TBD (e.g., cloud/provider constraints)
